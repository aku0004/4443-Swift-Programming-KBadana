Mobile location identification is done using the GPS system but the GPS system is not considered to be efficient in the indoor environments like shopping malls where location identification can be done using IR systems or RF systems. There are other different ways of location identification. Identifying the user location based on the WIFI to which he is connected is a way, but it needs to be focused on WIFI systems. We have identified that GPS is not a proper solution for location tracking of a user in a building. Looking at all these scenarios and situations location tracking system is created in the building to identify user location.  All the related hardware and software configurations for mobile tracking in a building will be discussed in this paper.  Other criteria like cost to ensure this can be implemented in almost all the buildings needs to be considered.
